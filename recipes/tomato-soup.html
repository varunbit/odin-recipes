        complex flavors and unique varieties.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pot on medium-low heat. The butter should melt and slightly simmer, but not burn.</li>
        <li>Next, add 2 bay leaves and fry them in the butter for a few seconds until lightly browned, but again, not burned.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon of finely chopped garlic and ⅓ cup of finely chopped onions to the pan, and stir.</li>
        <li> Sauté and stir until the onions become translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the fresh chopped tomatoes (500 grams, or 6 to 7 medium tomatoes), and a hearty pinch of salt to taste.
            chopped tomatoes with salt on top added in steel pan.</li>
        <li>Mix well, cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until the tomatoes soften, about 8 to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the consistency of the mixture. If the liquids dry up and the tomatoes begin to stick, then add a splash of water at a time and stir. </li>
        <li>Once the tomato mixture has cooled to a point that’s safe to work with, add it to a blender jar. You could also use an immersion blender. </li>
        <li>Next, add 1 teaspoon of raw sugar or white sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix it well and stir. Now serve the tomato soup.</li>
    </ol>
